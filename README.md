# Drone Flight Planner

## Description
System takes in map data and determines shortest path and safest path using
Drone controller. System uses a basic A*search algorithm to find. The graph of paths
is generated by finding the midpoint between obstacles. Designed to run on a raspberry pi
it can be run on desktops with a simulator. In the future I intend to make The
system more robust by adding a local obstacle and rerouting system.
